#Unit 4 Challenge

##Description

Work on this project was implemented at the request of the client, whose user story stated the following: AS A marketing student, I WANT a personal blog SO THAT I can showcase my thoughts and experiences."

The specific topics covered in the creation of this project include arrays, functions, methods, variables and constants, for-loops, and using Chrome Dev Tools to ensure that errors in coding are identified and resolved quickly.

The project solves the problem of the client being unable to document thoughts and experiences in a personal blog.

A great deal of knowledge was obtained through the design and completion of this project, from fortifying knowledge of HTML and CSS, expanding my knowledge of JavaScript, research of questions using the internet, the process of using Git and Github, and learning how to debug broken code.

The steps required to start the development environment running include: opening VS Code, Github, Git (and Terminal). Once the project was created on my local repo then it was linked to Github, to save changes as updates are made. In Github, a remote repo is created and linked via Git. Once this link was made using several Git terminal commands, the project was intitiated. The project was created using VS Code. It is here that the bulk of time designing was spent. Following these steps, the project and changes were uploaded to Github. The final project was then deployed to the web.

Below are screenshots of the project in various stages following the client’s approval and just before deployment:

1. The homepage of the project following completion, including light/dark modes:

2. An image of the second page following clicking on the "Submit" button, including light/dark modes:

3. An image of the console and main page after the "Back" button is clicked:

After completion of this project all of the following acceptance criteria have been met:

GIVEN a personal blog
WHEN I load the app,
THEN I am presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.
WHEN I submit the form,
THEN blog post data is stored to localStorage.
WHEN the form submits,
THEN I am redirected to the posts page.
WHEN I enter try to submit a form without a username, title, or content,
THEN I am presented with a message that prompts me to complete the form.
WHEN I view the posts page,
THEN I am presented with a header, with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button.
WHEN I click the light mode/dark mode toggle,
THEN the page content's styles update to reflect the selection.
WHEN I click the "Back" button,
THEN I am redirected back to the landing page where I can input more blog entries.
WHEN I view the main content,
THEN I am presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage.
WHEN I view localStorage,
THEN I am presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.
WHEN I take a closer look at a single blog entry in the list,
THEN I can see the title, the content, and the author of the post.
WHEN I view the footer,
THEN I am presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
